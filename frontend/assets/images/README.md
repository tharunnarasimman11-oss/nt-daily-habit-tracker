Place the app logo image here as `nt_logo.png`.

You provided a logo in the workspace attachments. Copy that image file into this folder and name it `nt_logo.png`.

Steps:
1. Save the attached image as `nt_logo.png`.
2. Put it in `frontend/assets/images/nt_logo.png`.
3. From the `frontend` folder run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

If you want, I can try to copy the attached image into this path for you — reply "copy it" to allow me to place it automatically.
